The garden acquired its present configuration in the two decades following John and Marie's marriage in 1923. From the beginning, Wiles Creek served as a landscape focus and the forest shade determined the selection of plants. Tens of thousands of Virginia bluebells that now cover the hillsides in late April are the progeny of 500 plants they purchased.",
